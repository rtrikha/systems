				<div class="body">Building structure into your thoughts, rather than solely focusing on solving the current problem at hand, is always a practice that will lead you far. Scaling becomes much easier when you have a framework that supports your reasoning, enabling you to address not only present challenges but also future ones. a framework that supports your reasoning not only aids in addressing present challenges but also fosters the ability to proactively anticipate and tackle future obstacles. It provides a roadmap that helps you identify patterns, identify underlying causes, and formulate long-term solutions. By consistently applying this structured thinking approach, you enhance your problem-solving skills and establish a more resilient mindset, preparing you to handle a wide range of situations that may arise along your journey.</div>
